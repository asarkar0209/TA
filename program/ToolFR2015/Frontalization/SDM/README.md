Code for superframe extraction from video frames based on paper- Semantic Text Summarization of Long Videos at 2017 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision
(http://www.cis.rit.edu/~sxs4337/publication/Sah_2017_WACV.pdf)

This code shows how to use superframes as a temporal segmentation. The code is a modified version of the one used in the initial publication: Gygli et al. - Creating Summaries from User Videos, ECCV 2014
https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~gyglim/vsum/#sf_code

The modifications include the addition of:
Contrast Saturation Sharpness FaceImpact 
and is the basis for Sah et al., WACV 2017
